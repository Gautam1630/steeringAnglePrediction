# Steering Angle Prediction
This repository attempt to  predict the appropriate steering angle for staying on the track in a driving simulator. It uses Convolutional Neural Network based on [End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) on a dataset obtained from driving in simulator.
You can install the simulator from the [Udacity repo](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).
